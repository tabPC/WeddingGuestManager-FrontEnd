# WeddingGuestManager-FrontEnd
Hi! This is my first Angular repo: the frontend for my mini project, a Wedding Guest Manager web-app built with Spring Boot and Angular. See the backend repo here: https://github.com/tabPC/WeddingGuestManager-BackEnd

This project is set up for my own developmental purposes.

Please see these resources used: [Spring Boot Full Stack with Angular Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx4iBLKLVHk&t=4444s&ab_channel=Amigoscode) and [Bootdey Snippet: BS4 Contact Cards](https://www.bootdey.com/snippets/view/bs4-contact-cards)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
